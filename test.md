- Payment processing speed
- System uptime and reliability
- User satisfaction metrics
- Revenue reconciliation accuracy

## 2. Expanded User Stories

- As a vehicle owner, I want to receive notifications when my position is approaching
- As a vehicle owner, I want to view historical queue performance data
- As a vehicle owner, I want to dispute unfair queue positioning
- As a vehicle owner, I want to receive daily/weekly earnings reports
- As a vehicle owner, I want to delegate queue management to my driver

### Sacco Admins
- As a Sacco admin, I want to manage multiple queues for different routes
- As a Sacco admin, I want to handle emergency priority cases
- As a Sacco admin, I want to generate revenue reports by vehicle/route
- As a Sacco admin, I want to manage vehicle documentation and compliance
- As a Sacco admin, I want to broadcast announcements to all queue participants
- As a Sacco admin, I want to handle vehicle breakdowns and replacements

### Route Managers
- As a route manager, I want to monitor vehicle distribution across routes
- As a route manager, I want to adjust queue priorities based on demand
- As a route manager, I want to manage peak vs. off-peak operations
- As a route manager, I want to track vehicle compliance with route assignments

### System Administrators
- As a system admin, I want to audit all system activities
- As a system admin, I want to manage system-wide configurations
- As a system admin, I want to handle inter-Sacco dispute resolution
- As a system admin, I want to generate regulatory compliance reports

## 3. Technical Architecture

### Frontend Components

#### Common Components
- LoadingSpinner
- ErrorBoundary
- Toast Notifications
- Confirmation Modals
- Data Tables with Sorting/Filtering

#### Vehicle Owner Interface
```typescript
interface VehicleOwnerDashboard {
  QueueStatus: {
    currentPosition: number;
    estimatedWaitTime: string;
    nextInLine: boolean;
    queueLength: number;
  };
  PaymentSection: {
    pendingAmount: number;
    paymentMethods: PaymentMethod[];
    transactionHistory: Transaction[];
  };

    vehicles: Vehicle[];
    documents: Document[];
    complianceStatus: ComplianceStatus;
  };
}
```

#### Sacco Admin Interface
```typescript
interface SaccoAdminDashboard {
  QueueManagement: {
    activeQueues: Queue[];
    pendingRequests: Request[];
    emergencyCases: Emergency[];
  };
  RevenueTracking: {
    dailyCollection: number;
    pendingPayments: Payment[];
    revenueByRoute: RouteRevenue[];
  };
  ComplianceMonitoring: {
    expiringDocuments: Document[];
    violationReports: Violation[];
    vehicleStatus: VehicleStatus[];
  };
}
```

### Real-time Features
- WebSocket connections for queue updates
- Server-Sent Events for announcements
- Push notifications for critical alerts
- Real-time payment confirmations
- Live vehicle tracking integration

## 4. Data Models

### Vehicle Entity
```typescript
interface Vehicle {
  id: string;
  registrationNumber: string;
  owner: Owner;
  documents: Document[];
  complianceStatus: ComplianceStatus;
  queueHistory: QueueEntry[];
  paymentHistory: Payment[];
  activeRoutes: Route[];
  status: 'active' | 'suspended' | 'maintenance';
}
```

### Queue Entry
```typescript
interface QueueEntry {
  id: string;
  vehicleId: string;
  entryTime: DateTime;
  estimatedDepartureTime: DateTime;
  priority: number;
  status: 'waiting' | 'ready' | 'departed' | 'cancelled';
  paymentStatus: 'pending' | 'paid' | 'failed';
  route: Route;
}
```
